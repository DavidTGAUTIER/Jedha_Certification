## Projet Bloc nÂ°1 : Kayak

This is my first project : Build a recommandation system based on weather for customers who want to go on holidays.

* Scraping data with scrapy librairy
* Get weather with Openweathermap API and Request librairy
* Get hotel's info with Booking.com
* Store all informations in data lake (AWS S3)
* ETL process from data lake to data warehouse (AWS RDS)

For financial reasons, i'd to delete content(dataframes, databases) on S3, RDS.

I started this project 1 month ago, and i updated it(more informations in dataframes, better viz,ect..)

I had a display issue for RDS management and SQL Alchemy but all informations are here.
